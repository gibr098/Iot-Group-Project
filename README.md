Our application is an interactive map of a smart building thanks to which people frequenting/visiting that building can access some useful real-time informations. In particular the user can see which are the level of crowding of some locations in the building, if there are free work stations/energy spots and where they are located and if there are accessible parks outside the building.
(?? The building has also an automatic regolation of the lights and air conditioning??)
