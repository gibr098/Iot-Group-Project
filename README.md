## **R.O.M.**  Room Occupancy Map
R.O.M. is an interactive map of a smart building that allows people frequently visiting the building to access useful real-time information about environmental monitoring. With R.O.M. the user can check the level of the crowdedness of a particular location of their choice in the building and immediately locate an available work space or study location. With R.O.M. the main problem of users spending more time searching for available workspace or conference room in big corporate buildings could potentially be solved.
