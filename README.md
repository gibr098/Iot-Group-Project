## **SBIM** : A Smart Building's Interactive Map
Our project is an interactive map of a smart building thanks to which people frequenting/visiting that building can access some useful real-time informations. In particular the user can see which are the level of crowding of some locations in the building, if there are free work stations/energy spots and where they are located and if there are accessible parking spots outside the building.
