## **SBIM** : A Smart Building's Interactive Map
SBIM is an interactive map of a smart building that allows people frequently visiting the building to access useful real-time information about environmental monitoring. With SBIM the user can check the level of the crowdedness of a particular location of their choice in the building. Using SBIM the user will be able to locate available work stations or available energy spots in the building. SBIM can be extended to use in the parking lot for users to identify available parking spots. With SBIM the main problem of users spending more time searching for available workspace or conference room in big corporate buildings could potentially be solved.
