Entering into the building, a person can easily access a web page in which he will find the the map of the edifice with all its locations. More than helping people to orientate in the structure, the map is also completely interactive giving the possibility to click on rooms and location to have informations about them. In particular if the user wants to know the level of crowding of a specific room, he will click on the interested location and pop up box will show how much it is frequented at the moment. The map shows also the position of the energy spots provided by the building, displaying the ones that are free to use and the ones that are currently busy.
