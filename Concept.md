## Room Occupancy Map
Have you ever wondered how many people there are in a room? Or wanted to implement a similar system in your store but you couldn't afford a people counting camera?
This is where our projects come in help! The basic gist of it is: we want to find a cheap way to count people, and to do so we need to be smart.

## Different cofigurations
This is the core of our project and ultimately our goal: in this github you will find data about several experiment with our sensors, every one of the well-documented. This is because there is no best configuration for every type of room, and thus we must see which one works better for what situation.
As of now, the basic configuration is this one:

but many more will follow, along qualitative and quantitative data.

## Main purpose
The idea for this project came in the form of an illness (or rather, the response to it) that is COVID-19. As of now, it's more than tree years that we are living under these conditions, and the need to enforce a restricion on the amount of people allowed in an enclosed space is very relevant. However, not every place has the personnel to keep count of the people and carefully respect these regulation, and if they cannot hire someone to do so, they probably don't have a lot of money to invest. And that's where this idea was born.

But this is not the only use for it, and in fact this can also be checked by a student so see which university room are occupied and which are not.
